# Hello-World
Using GitHubGuide's 10 min Intro from:      https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Have had this account for years, but never bothered doing things in an a-b-c step-by-step kinda way. No time like the present!

Primarily I use html, css, javascript, also ruby, java, android studio.
